My name is Jordan Sosnowski. 
I'm a student at Auburn University working towards a masters in Cybersecurity Engineering. 
I graduated from Auburn University May 2019 with my undergraduate in Software Engineering.

Outside of academia, I run Auburn's Ethical Hacking Club, participate in capture the flag competitions and try to keep up to date with the ever changing cybersecurity landscape.

My focus is on binary reverse engineering and binary exploitation. 
I have been running Auburn's EHC since 2017 and hosted our first CTF in 2019.
During 2020 we hope to have our first [public CTF](http://ctf.auburn.edu).

The purpose of this site is essentially a way of note keeping for me.
But note keeping that could, hopefully, help other people!
There will probably be mistakes in these posts and if you see any massive ones please email me so I can correct them!
I am still trying to figure out all this magic out.
