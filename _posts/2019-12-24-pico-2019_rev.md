In this post I will be going over the challenges I solved during picoCTF 2019.
picoCTF is a capture the flag competition aimed at Middle School and High School students; it is created by students at Carnegie Mellon.
It may be aimed for younger students but as I am still learning reverse engineering it was perfect for me. 
I participated with Auburn's Ethical Hacking Club.

# vault-door-training

## Problem

Your mission is to enter Dr. Evil's laboratory and retrieve the blueprints for his Doomsday Project. The laboratory is protected by a series of locked vault doors. Each door is controlled by a computer and requires a password to open. Unfortunately, our undercover agents have not been able to obtain the secret passwords for the vault doors, but one of our junior agents obtained the source code for each vault's computer! You will need to read the source code for each level to figure out what the password is for that vault door. As a warmup, we have created a replica vault in our training facility. The source code for the training vault is here: [VaultDoorTraining.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadrojisk/CTF_Writeups/master/2019-PicoCTF/rev/solved/vault-door-training/VaultDoorTraining.java)

Hint: The password is revealed in the program's source code.

## Solution

This challenge is meant to get your feet wet with reverse engineering. 
If you know Java the challenge is quite trivial.
We see it grabs the user's input and parses out `picoCTF{` and the last character which should be `}` if we are following the flag format.

```java
String userInput = scanner.next();
String input = userInput.substring("picoCTF{".length(),userInput.length()-1);
```

After that it passes our input to a `checkPassword` function.

```java
if (vaultDoor.checkPassword(input)) {
	System.out.println("Access granted.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Access denied!");
}
```

Looking into `checkPassword` we see it compares the parameter against `w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_ca5ae7fcc95`

```java
public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    return password.equals("w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_ca5ae7fcc95");
}
```

Therefore, if we send `picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_ca5ae7fcc95}` to the program we will be awarded with the good boy message `Access granted`.

The flag to submit on the pico challenge site is `picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_ca5ae7fcc95}`.


# vault-door-1

## Problem

This vault uses some complicated arrays! I hope you can make sense of it, special agent. The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor1.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadrojisk/CTF_Writeups/master/2019-PicoCTF/rev/solved/vault-door-1/VaultDoor1.java)

Hint: Look up the charAt() method online.

## Solution

Looking at the source code for this challenge it is very similiar to the training challenge.
However `checkPassword` is different.
It still compares our input against a hardcoded string, however this time the original plaintext version of the string has been obfuscated.
[`charAt(int index)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#charAt(int)) takes an integer that represents an index in the original string.
If you had `hello` and called `hello`.charAt(1) you would get `e` in return. 
There are multiple ways to solve this and my solution is most definitely not the prettiest.

```java
public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    return password.length() == 32 &&
            password.charAt(0)  == 'd' &&
            password.charAt(29) == '3' &&
            password.charAt(4)  == 'r' &&
            password.charAt(2)  == '5' &&
            password.charAt(23) == 'r' &&
            password.charAt(3)  == 'c' &&
            password.charAt(17) == '4' &&
            password.charAt(1)  == '3' &&
            password.charAt(7)  == 'b' &&
            password.charAt(10) == '_' &&
            password.charAt(5)  == '4' &&
            password.charAt(9)  == '3' &&
            password.charAt(11) == 't' &&
            password.charAt(15) == 'c' &&
            password.charAt(8)  == 'l' &&
            password.charAt(12) == 'H' &&
            password.charAt(20) == 'c' &&
            password.charAt(14) == '_' &&
            password.charAt(6)  == 'm' &&
            password.charAt(24) == '5' &&
            password.charAt(18) == 'r' &&
            password.charAt(13) == '3' &&
            password.charAt(19) == '4' &&
            password.charAt(21) == 'T' &&
            password.charAt(16) == 'H' &&
            password.charAt(27) == 'd' &&
            password.charAt(30) == '8' &&
            password.charAt(25) == '_' &&
            password.charAt(22) == '3' &&
            password.charAt(28) == '0' &&
            password.charAt(26) == '9' &&
            password.charAt(31) == 'f';
}
```

If we copy all the lines that contain `password.charAt...` into a text file called parsed_output we can run this bash script to get the flag.

```bash
$ sort -V parsed_output | cut -c 25 | tr -d "\n"
d35cr4mbl3_tH3_cH4r4cT3r5_9d038f%
```

We first sort the file using the version format. 
This works since in our input text we have strings that start the same and have a differing index value that can be treated as a "version number".
After that we cut all the text out except the character that should be at the specific index, and then we replace all the newline characters with a blank character.

Therefore our flag is `picoCTF{d35cr4mbl3_tH3_cH4r4cT3r5_9d038f}`.


# vault-door-3

## Problem

This vault uses for-loops and byte arrays. The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor3.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadrojisk/CTF_Writeups/master/2019-PicoCTF/rev/solved/vault-door-3/VaultDoor3.java)

Hint: Make a table that contains each value of the loop variables and the corresponding buffer index that it writes to.

## Solution

As we have seen before the main program is the same with the difference in the `checkPassword` function.
This time the function builds a new string based on our input; which needs to end up equalling `jU5t_a_sna_3lpm11ga4e_u_4_m9rf48`.

```java
public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    if (password.length() != 32) {
        return false;
    }
    char[] buffer = new char[32];
    int i;
    for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
        buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
    }
    for (; i<16; i++) {
        buffer[i] = password.charAt(23-i);
    }
    for (; i<32; i+=2) {
        buffer[i] = password.charAt(46-i);
    }
    for (i=31; i>=17; i-=2) {
        buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
    }
    String s = new String(buffer);
    return s.equals("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm11ga4e_u_4_m9rf48");
}
```

We see for the first 8 characters there is no character shuffling.

|--------------+-------------+----------------|
|    Input     |   Output    |    Character   | 
|:------------:+:-----------:+:--------------:|
|       0      |       0     |        j       |  
|       1      |       1     |        U       |
|       2      |       2     |        5       | 
|       3      |       3     |        t       |
|       4      |       4     |        _       |
|       5      |       5     |        a       | 
|       6      |       6     |        _       | 
|       7      |       7     |        s       |
|--------------+-------------+----------------|

```java
for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
    buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
}
```

However, characters 8 - 15, in the output array do NOT map to characters 8 - 15 in our original input array.
We see that they do map to `23 - i`; essentially writing the characters backwards from the original input.

```java
for (; i<16; i++) {
    buffer[i] = password.charAt(23-i);
}
```

With this we can create a table for characters 8 - 15.

|--------------+-------------|----------------|
|    Input     |   Output    |    Character   | 
|:------------:+:-----------:|:--------------:|
|       8      |      15     |        1       |  
|       9      |      14     |        m       |  
|      10      |      13     |        p       |  
|      11      |      12     |        l       |  
|      12      |      11     |        3       |  
|      13      |      10     |        _       |  
|      14      |       9     |        a       |  
|      15      |       8     |        n       |  
|--------------+-------------+----------------|

Now we do this again, but skip every other character.

```java
for (; i<32; i+=2) {
    buffer[i] = password.charAt(46-i);
}
```

|--------------+-------------|----------------|
|    Input     |   Output    |    Character   | 
|:------------:+:-----------:|:--------------:|
|      16      |      30     |        4       |  
|      18      |      28     |        r       |  
|      20      |      26     |        m       |  
|      22      |      24     |        4       |  
|      24      |      22     |        u       |  
|      26      |      20     |        e       |  
|      28      |      18     |        a       |  
|      30      |      16     |        1       |  
|--------------+-------------+----------------|

Now for the last transformation.
For this we use the characters we skipped over in the last transformation.

```java
for (i=31; i>=17; i-=2) {
    buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
}
```

|--------------+-------------|----------------|
|    Input     |   Output    |    Character   | 
|:------------:+:-----------:|:--------------:|
|      31      |      31     |        8       |  
|      29      |      29     |        f       |  
|      27      |      27     |        9       |  
|      25      |      25     |        _       |  
|      23      |      23     |        _       |  
|      21      |      21     |        _       |  
|      19      |      19     |        4       |  
|      17      |      17     |        g       |  
|--------------+-------------+----------------|

Therefore, putting all the mappings together we get out input strings should be `jU5t_a_s1mpl3_ang4r4m_4_u_e9af18`.
Giving this input to the program we will get the success message.
Therefore, our flag is `picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_e9af18}`.


# vault-door-4

## Problem

This vault uses ASCII encoding for the password. The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor4.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadrojisk/CTF_Writeups/master/2019-PicoCTF/rev/solved/vault-door-4/VaultDoor4.java)

Hint: Use a search engine to find an "ASCII table".

Hint: You will also need to know the difference between octal, decimal, and hexademical numbers.

## Solution

First let's look at the `checkPassword` function.
We can see that there's no array shuffling this time, thankfully.
This time it uses different ASCII representations to obscure the flag; with each line being a different representation.
The first line uses decimal values, the second line hexadecimal, the third octal, and the last plain ASCII.


```java
public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    byte[] passBytes = password.getBytes();
    byte[] myBytes = {
        106 , 85  , 53  , 116 , 95  , 52  , 95  , 98  ,
        0x55, 0x6e, 0x43, 0x68, 0x5f, 0x30, 0x66, 0x5f,
        0142, 0131, 0164, 063 , 0163, 0137, 070 , 060 ,
        'f' , '8' , 'e' , '1' , 'e' , '0' , '4' , '7' ,
    };
    for (int i=0; i<32; i++) {
        if (passBytes[i] != myBytes[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

Using Python 2 we can quickly convert this array.
Python 3's octal format is not 0NUMBER like Java, but Python 2's is.
Python 3 uses 0oNUMBER like 0o142.
Running this in Python 2 we can get our flag; `jU5t_4_bUnCh_0f_bYt3s_80f8e1e047`.

```python
enc = [
    106 , 85  , 53  , 116 , 95  , 52  , 95  , 98  ,
    0x55, 0x6e, 0x43, 0x68, 0x5f, 0x30, 0x66, 0x5f,
    0142, 0131, 0164, 063 , 0163, 0137, 070 , 060]
plain = ['f' , '8' , 'e' , '1' , 'e' , '0' , '4' , '7']
print ''.join(map(chr, enc) + plain)
```

# vault-door-5

## Problem

In the last challenge, you mastered octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, but this vault door uses a different change of base as well as URL encoding! The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor5.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadrojisk/CTF_Writeups/master/2019-PicoCTF/rev/solved/vault-door-5/VaultDoor5.java)

Hint: You may find an encoder/decoder tool helpful, such as https://encoding.tools/

Hint: Read the wikipedia articles on URL encoding and base 64 encoding to understand how they work and what the results look like.

## Solution 

Looking at the source code this challenge is quite trivial.
`urlEncode` parses a string and converts it to the [URL Encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp) equivalent.
After that it simple uses a base 64 encoding scheme on the URL encoded output.

```java
public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    String urlEncoded = urlEncode(password.getBytes());
    String base64Encoded = base64Encode(urlEncoded.getBytes());
    String expected = "JTYzJTMwJTZlJTc2JTMzJTcyJTc0JTMxJTZlJTY3JTVm"\
                    + "JTY2JTcyJTMwJTZkJTVmJTYyJTYxJTM1JTY1JTVmJTM2"\
                    + "JTM0JTVmJTY0JTYxJTM4JTM4JTMyJTY0JTMwJTMx";
    return base64Encoded.equals(expected);
}
```

Now that we know how this challenge obscures the input it is relatively easy to solve. 
We can use a Python script to solve this.
In this script we first decode the base 64 encryption.
Following that we strip out the leading and ending percent signs, if we do not it will mess up the latter steps.
After this we will treat the percent sign as a delimiter and split the string at each instance of one. 
At this point we now have a list of hexadecimal characters which need to be converted to their ASCII equivalents.
We first convert the string representation of the hexadecimal numbers to integers and pass them to `chr` using `map`.

```python
import base64 
print(''.join(map(chr, [int(x, 16) for x in base64.b64decode(expected).decode().strip('%').split('%')])))
```

Running the Python script we get this in return; `c0nv3rt1ng_fr0m_ba5e_64_da882d01`.
Therefore, our flag is `picoCTF{c0nv3rt1ng_fr0m_ba5e_64_da882d01}`.


# vault-door-6

## Problem

This vault uses an XOR encryption scheme. The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor6.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadrojisk/CTF_Writeups/master/2019-PicoCTF/rev/solved/vault-door-6/VaultDoor6.java)

Hint: If X ^ Y = Z, then Z ^ Y = X. Write a program that decrypts the flag based on this fact.

## Solution

Looking at the `checkPassword` function we see this challenge obscures the flag with a simple XOR encryption. 
The key used in the XOR encryption is `0x55`.
The great about XOR encryption is that the key used to encrypt is used to decrypt, and the algorithm used to decrypt is the same used to encrypt; an XOR operation.

```java
public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    if (password.length() != 32) {
        return false;
    }
    byte[] passBytes = password.getBytes();
    byte[] myBytes = {
        0x3b, 0x65, 0x21, 0xa , 0x38, 0x0 , 0x36, 0x1d,
        0xa , 0x3d, 0x61, 0x27, 0x11, 0x66, 0x27, 0xa ,
        0x21, 0x1d, 0x61, 0x3b, 0xa , 0x2d, 0x65, 0x27,
        0xa , 0x63, 0x65, 0x64, 0x67, 0x37, 0x6d, 0x62,
    };
    for (int i=0; i<32; i++) {
        if (((passBytes[i] ^ 0x55) - myBytes[i]) != 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

To solve this all we need to do is run a quick Python script.
We use a simple list comprehension to quickly XOR all the bytes, following that we print out the ASCII representation.
We get the following output: `n0t_mUcH_h4rD3r_tH4n_x0r_6012b87`.
Therefore, our flag is `picoCTF{n0t_mUcH_h4rD3r_tH4n_x0r_6012b87}`.

```python
enc = [
        0x3b, 0x65, 0x21, 0xa , 0x38, 0x0 , 0x36, 0x1d,
        0xa , 0x3d, 0x61, 0x27, 0x11, 0x66, 0x27, 0xa ,
        0x21, 0x1d, 0x61, 0x3b, 0xa , 0x2d, 0x65, 0x27,
        0xa , 0x63, 0x65, 0x64, 0x67, 0x37, 0x6d, 0x62,]
print(''.join(map(chr, [ x ^ 0x55 for x in enc])))
```

# vault-door-7

## Problem

This vault uses bit shifts to convert a password string into an array of integers. Hurry, agent, we are running out of time to stop Dr. Evil's nefarious plans! The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor7.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadrojisk/CTF_Writeups/master/2019-PicoCTF/rev/solved/vault-door-7/VaultDoor7.java)

Hint: Use a decimal/hexademical converter such as this one: [https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal-converter.html](https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal-converter.html)

Hint: You will also need to consult an ASCII table such as this one: [https://www.asciitable.com/](https://www.asciitable.com/)

## Solution

Looking at the source for this challenge we see it is a little different than the other ones we have faced.
This time we need to understand bit shifting.

We see within the normal `checkPassword` function we pass our input `password` to a `passwordToIntArray` function following that it checks the output with some hardcoded values.
The first thing we should do is looking into how the output array is generate by `passwordToIntArray`.

```java
public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    if (password.length() != 32) {
        return false;
    }
    int[] x = passwordToIntArray(password);
    return x[0] == 1096770097
        && x[1] == 1952395366
        && x[2] == 1600270708
        && x[3] == 1601398833
        && x[4] == 1716808014
        && x[5] == 1734304870
        && x[6] == 895891557
        && x[7] == 1681142832;
}
```

Inside `passwordToIntArray` we see it takes a string which it refers to as `hex`.
It generates an empty int array of size 8 and then uses the strings [`getBytes`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#getBytes()) function on hex.
This will encode the string as a sequence of bytes and return the output as an array.
Following the conversion of our input array we enter a for loop that is ran 8 times, with four characters of our input string being transformed each run.
The `<<` refers to a bit shift, a signed bit shift to the left, in Java.
So if we had `0001` and performed << 2 we would have `0100` as an output.
Therefore, if we perform a bit shift << 24 on an hexadecimal representation of an ASCII character its original 8 will be shifted 24 places to the left. 
In Java an integer, which is the type these bits are being transformed into, is 4 bytes or 32 bits. 
If our first character was an `A` it would be `0x41` in hexadecimal and `0b1000001` in binary. Placing it into an integer we would zero extend to the 31 place.
Therefore our `A` would look like `0b00000000000000000000000001000001` and performing a bit shift of 24 would then convert our output to `0b10000010000000000000000000000000`.
So, in short we push our bits that encode an `A` all the way to the most significant bit.
This is done three more times, except we do a bit shift of `16`, then `8`, and then of `0`.
So in reality all we are doing is smashing four hexadecimal characters together.
If we originally had `ABCD` they would be encoded as 0x41 0x42 0x43 0x44 in our `hexBytes` but then in the for loop they as smashed together to equal `0x41424344` or `1094861636`.

```java
public int[] passwordToIntArray(String hex) {
    int[] x = new int[8];
    byte[] hexBytes = hex.getBytes();
    for (int i=0; i<8; i++) {
        x[i] = hexBytes[i*4]   << 24
                | hexBytes[i*4+1] << 16
                | hexBytes[i*4+2] << 8
                | hexBytes[i*4+3];
    }
    return x;
}
```

So all we need to do to decode this is take our hard coded values, translate them into hexadecimal values and then split those hexadecimal values at byte boundaries and convert back to ASCII.

```python
dec = [1096770097, 1952395366,
 1600270708, 1601398833,
 1716808014, 1734304870,
 895891557, 1681142832]
for d in dec:
    value = hex(d)[2:]
    for i in range(0, len(value), 2):
        print(chr(int(value[i: i+2],16)),end ='')
```

Running the Python script we will get `A_b1t_0f_b1t_sh1fTiNg_df5f8ed440` which if we input into the program we get the success message.
Therefore our flag is `picoCTF{A_b1t_0f_b1t_sh1fTiNg_df5f8ed440}`.

# vault-door-8

## Problem

Apparently Dr. Evil's minions knew that our agency was making copies of their source code, because they intentionally sabotaged this source code in order to make it harder for our agents to analyze and crack into! The result is a quite mess, but I trust that my best special agent will find a way to solve it. The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor8.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadrojisk/CTF_Writeups/master/2019-PicoCTF/rev/solved/vault-door-8/VaultDoor8.java)

Hint: Clean up the source code so that you can read it and understand what is going on.

Hint: Draw a diagram to illustrate which bits are being switched in the scramble() method, then figure out a sequence of bit switches to undo it. You should be able to reuse the switchBits() method as is.

## Solution

This challenge took me the most amount of time out of all the vault door challenges.
First things first, we need to clean up this obfuscated source code.
I used [tutorialspoint online Java formatter](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_java_formatter.htm), but anything will do the trick.

```java
// These pesky special agents keep reverse engineering our source code and then
// breaking into our secret vaults. THIS will teach those sneaky sneaks a
// lesson.

class VaultDoor8 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner b = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter vault password: ");
        String c = b.next();
        String f = c.substring(8, c.length() - 1);
        VaultDoor8 a = new VaultDoor8();
        if (a.checkPassword(f)) {
            System.out.println("Access granted.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access denied!");
        }
    }
    public char[] scramble(String password) { /* Scramble a password by transposing pairs of bits. */
        char[] a = password.toCharArray();
        for (int b = 0; b < a.length; b++) {
            char c = a[b];
            c = switchBits(c, 1, 2);
            c = switchBits(c, 0, 3); /* c = switchBits(c,14,3); c = switchBits(c, 2, 0); */
            c = switchBits(c, 5, 6);
            c = switchBits(c, 4, 7);
            c = switchBits(c, 0, 1); /* d = switchBits(d, 4, 5); e = switchBits(e, 5, 6); */
            c = switchBits(c, 3, 4);
            c = switchBits(c, 2, 5);
            c = switchBits(c, 6, 7);
            a[b] = c;
        }
        return a;
    }
    public char switchBits(char c, int p1, int p2) {
        /* Move the bit in position p1 to position p2, and move the bit
        that was in position p2 to position p1. Precondition: p1 < p2 */
        char mask1 = (char)(1 << p1);
        char mask2 = (char)(1 << p2); /* char mask3 = (char)(1<<p1<<p2); mask1++; mask1--; */
        char bit1 = (char)(c & mask1);
        char bit2 = (char)(c & mask2);
        /* 
        System.out.println("bit1 " + Integer.toBinaryString(bit1));
        System.out.println("bit2 " + Integer.toBinaryString(bit2)); 
        */
        char rest = (char)(c & ~(mask1 | mask2));
        char shift = (char)(p2 - p1);
        char result = (char)((bit1 << shift) | (bit2 >> shift) | rest);
        return result;
    }
    public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
        char[] scrambled = scramble(password);
        char[] expected = {
            0xF4,0xC0,0x97, 0xF0, 0x77, 0x97, 0xC0, 0xE4, 
            0xF0, 0x77, 0xA4, 0xD0, 0xC5, 0x77, 0xF4, 0x86,
            0xD0, 0xA5, 0x45, 0x96, 0x27, 0xB5, 0x77, 0xC0, 
            0xB4, 0xD1, 0xD2, 0x85, 0xA4, 0xA5, 0xC1,0x85};
        return Arrays.equals(scrambled, expected);
    }
}
```

Instead of trying to figure out how the bit swapping works I just changed the source code by reversing the calls in `scramble`.
We will also need to change the input parameter to a character array since we will no longer be passing it a string.

```java
public char[] scramble(char [] a) { 
    for (int b = 0; b < a.length; b++) {
        char c = a[b];
        c = switchBits(c, 6, 7);
        c = switchBits(c, 2, 5);
        c = switchBits(c, 3, 4);
        c = switchBits(c, 0, 1); 
        c = switchBits(c, 4, 7);
        c = switchBits(c, 5, 6);
        c = switchBits(c, 0, 3);
        c = switchBits(c, 1, 2); 
        a[b] = c;
    }
    return a;
}
```

If we then change `checkPassword` to pass expected to `scramble` we can de-scramble the obscured flag and print out the output we should receive the flag.
An additional change to `checkPassword` is to remove the parameter that is passed to it.
Also we will need to change the main so it does not expect input from us anymore.

```java
public void checkPassword() {
    
    char[] expected = {
        0xF4,0xC0,0x97, 0xF0, 0x77, 0x97, 0xC0, 0xE4, 
        0xF0, 0x77, 0xA4, 0xD0, 0xC5, 0x77, 0xF4, 0x86,
        0xD0, 0xA5, 0x45, 0x96, 0x27, 0xB5, 0x77, 0xC0, 
        0xB4, 0xD1, 0xD2, 0x85, 0xA4, 0xA5, 0xC1,0x85};
    char[] descrambled = scramble(expected);
    System.out.println(descrambled);
}

public static void main(String args[]) {
    VaultDoor8 a = new VaultDoor8();
    a.checkPassword();
}
```

Now running the program we will get `s0m3_m0r3_b1t_sh1fTiNg_0c59dbf4d` as the output. 
Running the original program and supplying that as the input will give us the good boy message.
Therefore, our flag is `picoCTF{s0m3_m0r3_b1t_sh1fTiNg_0c59dbf4d}`.
