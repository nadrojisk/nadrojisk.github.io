In this post will be answering the questions in the PMA book for chapter one's labs.

## Lab 1-1

1. Upload the files to [http://www.VirusTotal.com/](http://www.VirusTotal.com/) and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
2. When were these files compiled?
3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are the indicators?
4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?
6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?
7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?

### Virus Total

Running Lab01-1.exe on virus total it matches against a multitude of other antivirus signatures.

Running Lab01-1.dll on virus total matches less than the executable but still matches on a large portion.

### Compilation Date

Using PPEE I was able to locate the dates of compilation. 
CFF Explorer lists the value for the date but does not translate it into something readable.

Lab01-1.exe was compiled December 19, 2010 at 4:16:19 PM.

### Obfuscation

As discussed in the [Chapter One summary](../pma-1/#packed-binaries) there are a multitude of ways to see if a binary is packed.
We will try them all, it is not necessary to be this exhaustive in a normal analysis but as this is a learning experience we will be.
First we will analyze the strings of the binary. 
Running `strings -n 4 Lab01.exe` we can get this. Most of it is garbage.

WARNING_THIS_WILL_DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE
```

Usually user strings are located at the bottom of the dump.
Some of these users strings are very suspicious.
Especially the one that misspells kernel32.dll as kerne**1**32.dll.

```
kerne132.dll
kernel32.dll
.exe
C:\*
C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll
Kernel32.
Lab01-01.dll
C:\Windows\System32\Kernel32.dll
WARNING_THIS_WILL_DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE
```

Located above them one can see different functions and libraries used by the program.

This program definitely does not look packed as there are very obviously user strings present.
However, we should attempt further analysis.

Analyzing the size and the names of the sections can give us further evidence if this program is packed.
We can use PPEE to do this.
The sections are ones we would expect to see in a PE file and the virtual sizes are not larger than the raw sizes.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1-sections.png)

One last check to do to see if this file is packed is running PEiD.
We can see that Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 was used to build the binary.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1-peid.png)

Based on our findings it does not seem that Lab01-1.exe is not packed.
For Lab01-1.dll we will just simply used PEiD to check if it is packed and we can see that it is not.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1_dll-peid.png)

### Imports

Now lets look at the imports and see if we can gain any idea on what the functionality of this malware may be.
Using PPEE we can see the different functions and libraries dynamically linked by Lab01-1.exe.
They should seem familiar, that's because we listed them earlier with strings.
Based on the functions used from KERNEL32.dll it looks like our program will be looping through different files with `FindFirstFileA`, `FindNextFileA`, and `FindClose`.
It also looks like it will be attempting to copy a file with `CopyFileA` and load a file into memory with `MapViewOfFile` and `UnmapeViewOfFile`.
Mapping files can allow programs to modify PE files.
There is not really anything too interesting located in the MSVCRT.dll listing as that DLL contains the C Runtime libraries.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1-kernel32.png)

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1-msvcrt.png)

Looking into Lab01-1.dll with PPEE we can see what the DLL links dynamically.
KERNEL32.dll has less functions this time, however they are very intersting.
It looks like this DLL might be trying to spawn its own processes with `CreateProcessA`.
It is also using `Sleep`; perhaps to slow down execution of the malware so it does not consume the host's resources.
We also have `CreateMutexA` and `OpenMutexA` mutexes are used by malwares to limit how many instances of the malware are running at once.
Using mutexes, a malware will generate a mutex, usually with a hardcoded name, upon running.
If the same malware were to try to run while one version of it is already running it would try to open that same mutex that is already in existence.
An error would be thrown and the malware would then know a version of itself is already running and that it should stop.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1_dll-kernel32.png)

WS2_32.dll is very interesting as it is a networking library.
We can see that this DLL is trying to make a connection with `connect` and trying to send and receive data with `send` and `recv`.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1_dll-ws2.png)

For this DLL all the functions are being imported by their ordinals instead of by name.
This is a form of obfuscation by malware authors.
Using ordinals obscures which function is being used as they are not listed in cleartext.

**NOTE**: PPEE cross references the ordinals and locates the function names.
If you were to use PEview they would not have been listed and you would have to use a tool like dependance walker to find the names.
{: .notice--warning}

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1_dll-ordinals.png)

Just like with the executable there is not much going on in MSVCRT.dll

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1_dll-msvcrt.png)

### Host-Based Indicators

Based on what we have seen so far for Lab01-1.exe we could write a host-based indicator that looks for files called `Kerne132.dll`.
We have not looked at the strings for Lab01-1.dll, perhaps there could be something there that may be useful for a host-based indicator.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-1/lab1_dll-strings.png)

Unfortunately, there is not anything in the strings dump or that we have seen so far in Lab01-1.dll that would help for a host-based indicator.
However there is a network-based indicator we could use.

### Network-Based Indicators

Located in the strings for Lab01-1.dll there is a hard coded IP address; `127.26.152.13`.
This could be used for a network-based indicator that would detect this malware.
There is not anything in the lab one executable network wise.

### Purpose of Lab One

After analyzing the executable and the dll there are some educated guesses we can make about the purpose of this malware.
We know that the executable searches through files and maps a file into memory that it can then edit.
Also we know the dll opens its own processes and has network capabilities.
There are also some odd strings located in the dll that look like they could be commands.
We cannot make any hard guess but at this point in time we can guess that the executable uses the DLL to establish a backdoor on the host to receive commands from a server.

## Lab 1-2

1. Upload the files to [http://www.VirusTotal.com/](http://www.VirusTotal.com/) and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
2. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are the indicators?
3. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?

### Virus Total

Running Lab01-2.exe we can see 43 different anti viruses are triggered by this file.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-2/lab2-virustotal.png)

### Obfuscated

When using PEiD on the binary it does not detect anything. 
However, we do see something telling; the EP section is UPX1, it should be .text.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-2/lab2-peid.png)

Running PPEE we can see all the sections are UPX0 UPX1, and UPX2.
This is very suspicious.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-2/lab2-sections.png)

Doing a quick google search on UPX we can see it is a common packer.
We can quickly download it and use the following command to unpack the binary.

```bash
$ upx -d -o Lab01-02_unpacked.exe Lab01-02.exe
```

If the file unpacks successfully you should see the following text.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-2/lab2-unpacking.png)


### Imports

Once the file is unpacked we can look at the imported functions.

The functions imported by KERNEL32.dll allow the program to create threads, create timers, and open mutexes.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-2/lab2-kernel32.png)

The functions imported by ADVAPI32.dll are usually related to the registry or services.
We can see this malware is using functions tied to services.
Services can be used as a way of achieving persistence.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-2/lab2-advapi.png)

Once again MSVCRT.dll contains pretty boilerplate functions.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-2/lab2-msvcrt.png)

WININIT.dll contains functions for higher level networking capabilities such as HTTP.
It looks like this malware will be using those functions to open a connection to the internet to a specific URL.

![](/assets/img/posts/ch1/lab1-2/lab2-wininit.png)

### Host/Network-Based Indicators

Looking at the strings located in this binary we can see some stuff that may be used for host/network-based indicators.
We could write a rule that searches for connections to `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com`.
The `Internet Explorer 8.0` could be a user agent.
So we could have a rule looking for user agents of that value as well.
If we make an assumption and assume `HGL345` is a Mutex name we could search on the hosts for mutexes that match this value.
Since we know the binary is messing around with services we could also look for services called `MalService`.

## Lab 1-3

1. Upload the files to [http://www.VirusTotal.com/](http://www.VirusTotal.com/) and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
2. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are the indicators?
3. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?
